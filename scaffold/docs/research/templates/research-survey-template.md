# Research Survey Template

Use this for `RSCH-*` docs: sourced surveys that answer "what options exist?" before the team is ready to choose, specify, evaluate, or build.

Create new surveys with:

```bash
scripts/docs-meta new research "<Title>" --domain <domain>
```

# RSCH-#### - <Research Survey Title>

## Question

State the research question in one sentence.

## Context

Why does this need a survey instead of a quick answer or raw idea?

## External Sources

Separate external sources from repo facts and agent summaries.

## Repo / Internal Findings

Facts from this repo, local experiments, existing docs, or code.

## Agent Notes

Subagent findings or chat-derived summaries. Mark these as synthesis, not primary evidence.

## Options Compared

## Findings

## Risks / Unknowns

## Recommendation

Give a shortlist, recommended next step, or next-question set. Do not lock durable architecture decisions here; use an ADR when needed.

## Follow-Ups

- <Next survey, evaluation, spec, ADR, or plan to create>
